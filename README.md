## Custom CSS Classes

Different CSS classes were created  to detail the presentation of the web page's markup language (HTML)
such as colors, fonts, and layout.

.social-icons
.text-primary
.container

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```

JavaScript was use to provide more User Interaction and  validate user input.  Being client-side, JavaScript is
very fast because any code functions can be run immediately instead of having to contact the server and wait for an answer.

Some javascript functions used are:

function validateForm(form)
function validateEmail(input)
function validateRequired(input) {

```
